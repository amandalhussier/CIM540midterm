Title: Donation Page for the Ron Magill Conservation Endowment

I am making this project for my STC436 Public Relations Campaign class. This is the capstone course for all public relations majors, where we are assigned a real-life client to do public relations services for. The Ron Magill Conservation Endowment needs both a website and a donation page for that website. I will be working on the website on my own time, but the midterm for this class would be making a donation page because that could use interactive coding.

Inputs and Outputs
I have four buttons that will eventually lead to donation links to donate to the Ron Magill Conservation Endowment, but for now, they change the color of the background below the koala picture.
I also have a hitzone near the donation buttons that will show balloons.


Target audience:
Target audience: potential donors to the Ron Magill Conservation Endowment
